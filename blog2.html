            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet . The graphic and typographic operators know this well, in reality all the
            professions dealing with the universe of communication have a stable relationship with these words, but what
            is it? Lorem ipsum is a dummy text without any sense.
        </p>
        <h2>Why do you use?</h2>

        <p>The Lorem ipum filling text is used by graphic designers, programmers and printers with the aim of occupying
            the spaces of a website, an advertising product or an editorial production whose final text is not yet
            ready.

            This expedient serves to get an idea of the finished product that will soon be printed or disseminated via
            digital channels.

            In order to have a result that is more in keeping with the final result, the graphic designers, designers or
            typographers report the Lorem ipsum text in respect of two fundamental aspects, namely readability and
            editorial requirements.

            The choice of font and font size with which Lorem ipsum is reproduced answers to specific needs that go
            beyond the simple and simple filling of spaces dedicated to accepting real texts and allowing to have hands
            an advertising/publishing product, both web and paper, true to reality.

            Its nonsense allows the eye to focus only on the graphic layout objectively evaluating the stylistic choices
            of a project, so it is installed on many graphic programs on many software platforms of personal publishing
            and content management system.
        </p>
        <h2>Incomprehensibility or readability? That is the question.</h2>
        <p>
            The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated in the 16th century.
            Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It
            contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient
            dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European languages in Latin script.
            The advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is
            that the text does not attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the layout.
